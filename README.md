 # Prework Study Guide Webpage 

## Description

The reasoning I wanted to create a Prework Study Guide page is to understand the basics of Web Developing/coding and become one step closer to achieving my goals. 

Building this Webpage will help me with my future assignments as I will look back on this project of how I created basic templates as well as how I prepared and finalised it. Hopefully this will help not just me but other new developers as well. I have learnt the basic fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GitBash and Github. I cannot wait to learn more and develop my current skills.
